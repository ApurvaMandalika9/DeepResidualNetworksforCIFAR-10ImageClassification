# DeepResidualNetworksforCIFAR-10ImageClassification

In this classification task, models will take a 32 Ã— 32 image with RGB channels as inputs and classify the image into one of ten pre-defined classes.

Two versions of ResNet were implemented: version 1 uses original residual blocks and version 2 uses full pre-activation residual blocks. In particular, for version 2, bottleneck blocks were implemented instead of standard residual blocks.
